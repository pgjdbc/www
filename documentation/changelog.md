* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Improved support for BLOBS [PR #219](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/219)
* 	  Added the support for very large objects (4TB) when backend is at least 9.3 using lo_xxx64 functions (see release 9.3 notes).
* 	  Added support for various JDBC4 methods related to Blobs:  
      setBlob with input stream in PreparedStatement  
      getBinaryStream with position and offset in Blob (also helps a lot handling very large objects)
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg)	Fix for setStringType in DataSource [PR #221](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/221)

Author: [bryonv](https://github.com/byronvf)

* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Honor stringtype=unspecified when also saving null values  
*   Currently, saving a string with setString applies oid.UNSPECIFIED, but saving null with setNull(index, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR) saves with oid.VARCHAR.
*   For consistency, if the user requested that we treat string types as unspecified, we should do so in all cases.

    do instead.
    
    The message looks like:
    
    ------------
    PostgreSQL x.y JDBC4.1 (build bbbb)
    Found in: jar:file:/path/to/postgresql-x.y-bbbb.jdbc41.jar!/org/postgresql/Driver.class
    
    The PgJDBC driver is not an executable Java program.
    
    You must install it according to the JDBC driver installation instructions for your application / container / appserver, then use it by specifying a JDBC URL of the form
        jdbc:postgresql://
    or using an application specific method.
    
    See the PgJDBC documentation: http://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/index.html
    
    This command has had no effect.

    fixed bug PreparedStatement.getMetaData failed if result set was closed
    reported by Emmanuel Guiton

Author: cchantep <chantepie@altern.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 12 15:54:55 2013 +0100

    Base table more usefull than "" as basic table name


    fixed driver fails to find foreign tables fix from plalg@hotmail.com

Author: Heikki Linnakangas <heikki.linnakangas@iki.fi>

    Fix various setQueryTimeout bugs.
    
    1. If you call setQueryTimeout(5), wait 10 seconds, and call execute(), the
    cancel timer has already expired, and the statement will be allowed to run
    forever. Likewise, if you call setQueryTimeout(5), wait 4 seconds, and call
    execute(), the statement will be canceled after only 1 second.
    
    2. If you call setQueryTimeout on a PreparedStatement, and execute the same
    statement several times, the timeout only takes affect on the first
    statement.
    
    3. If you call setQueryTimeout on one Statement, but don't execute it, the
    timer will still fire, possible on an unrelated victim Statement.
    
    The root cause of all of these bugs was that the timer was started at the
    setQueryTimeout() call, not on the execute() call.
    
    Also, remove the finally-block from the cancellation task's run-method,
    because that might erroneously cancel the timer for the next query, if a
    new query is started using the same statement fast enough.

Author: Heikki Linnakangas <heikki.linnakangas@iki.fi>

    Use StringBuffer to construct a string.
    
    This piece of code isn't performance-critical at all, but silences a
    Coverity complaint.

Author: Heikki Linnakangas <heikki.linnakangas@iki.fi>

    Avoid integer overflow.
    
    The function returns long, but does the calculation first in int. If someone
    sets the timeout to 600 hours in the URL, it will overflow, even though the
    return value of the function is long and hence could return a larger value.
    
    To silence a Coverity complaint.

Author: Heikki Linnakangas <heikki.linnakangas@iki.fi>

    Plug some Statement leaks in metadata queries.
    
    These are fairly harmless, nobody calls these metadata methods frequently
    enough for the leaks to matter, and a regular Statement doesn't hold onto
    any server resources anyway. But let's appease Coverity.

Author: Heikki Linnakangas <heikki.linnakangas@iki.fi>

    Make sure file is closed on exception.
    
    The system will eventually close the file anyway, and this read is highly
    unlikely to throw an IOException in practice.
    
    Also, use RandomAccessFile.readFully(byte[]) to slurp the file into byte
    array, rather than FileInputStream.read(byte[]). The latter would need to
    be called in a loop to protect from short reads.
    
    Both issues were complained of by Coverity.

    Update URLs in README to refer to the Oracle page locations
    
    Oracle has been doing a very poor job of maintaining old SUN URLs,
    and it's likely that these will break at some point, so best update
    them to reflect Oracle's control of Java now.
    
    Added a link to the JDBC tutorial in the process.

Date:   Thu Sep 20 14:02:18 2012 +0800

    Allow testing to continue when local host name doesn't resolve
    
    It seems to be a common and default configuration on some Linux systems
    for the local hostname not to resolve to the loopback IP address. This
    causes testTimeoutOccurs(org.postgresql.test.jdbc2.LoginTimeoutTest)
    to fail. I'm seeing this on Fedora 17 among others.
    
    While it's best to fix such systems, not causing an easily avoided
    and spurious failure in PgJDBC's test suite is probably worthwhile.
    Spit out a warning and continue.

    Use a Set instead of a BitSet for tracking which types support
    binary transfer.
    
    A BitSet is a compact representation if we're only considering
    builtin types that will have low oids, but if any user defined
    types are enabled, all bets are off.  Once the oid counter exceeds
    INT_MAX, database connections were failing outright even if no
    high oid types used binary transfer because we represent these
    oids with negative values that a BitSet cannot handle.

    Fix ResultSetMetaData retrieval when the oid counter exceeds INT_MAX.

    Move logic out of concrete JDBC version classes.
    
    The concrete JDBC implementation classes should do as little work
    as possible.  They exist solely to connect the right set of concrete
    implemention classes, leaving all the real work to the Abstract
    versions.  Some logic had started to creep out into these concrete
    classes which is bad because it duplicates code in paths that aren't
    likely to be tested by a developer who is working primarily with a
    single JDK version.

    Cache a copy of ResultSetMetaData in the ResultSet.
    
    This solves a major performance problem for ResultSetMetaData users
    which did not cache the ResultSetMetaData object.  One of the users
    is the driver's own implementation of updatable ResultSets, so this
    can't be worked around solely in end user code.
    
    In the 9.0 and earlier releases, the Field objects were used to hold
    database lookup results and these were longer lived than the
    ResultSetMetaData object.  Now that ResultSetMetaData is holding
    these database lookups we must hold onto the object to avoid
    repeating the database queries.
    
    Reported as bug #6293, fix by Steven Schlansker.

    Test is checking search_path usage dirctly on TypeInfo methods

Author: Valentine Gogichashvili 
Date:   Fri Apr 12 02:35:27 2013 +0200

    Consider search_path when resolving type names to OIDs
    
    In case when types with the same name existed in several schemas,
    TypeInfoCache did not consider the current search_path and was choosing
    an OID of a type not deterministically. These change will make
    the type from the current schema to be chosen. Also this change remains
    backwards compatible with the previous implementation, still being anble
    to find a type, that is not included into the current search_path.
    
    Provided test fails now, as it does not TypeInfoCache
    directly. So more work is to be done to make this test work.

    Expose enhanced error message fields from constraint violations.
    
    The server now provides the schema, table, column, datatype, and
    constraint names for certain errors.  So expose that to users so
    they don't have to go rummaging through the error text trying
    to find it.
    
    The server doesn't always provide all the fields and doesn't cover
    all the error messages, but it's a good start.  In the future it
    would be good to expose this information in a PGXXX class instead
    of the supposedly private ServerErrorMessage.

    SSL client certificate via Keystore from a Resource file provided by Brendan Jurd
    
    It seems that the most common way to deal with this situation is to
    specify the keystore file and the password via system properties
    (javax.net.ssl.keyStore et. al.), but that wasn't suitable in my case.
     I needed to be able to load the keystore from a Resource file
    embedded in the compiled JAR.
    
    The class I came up with is attached.  It builds on the WrappedFactory
    provided in jdbc-postgres.  All the implementer needs to do is
    override the two abstract methods to provide an InputStream of the key
    store, and the password to access it.  The InputStream could be a
    FileInputStream, or an InputStream returned by getResource(), or
    whatever.
    
    This class uses the same keystore for KeyManager (selecting the
    key/cert to send as the client) and for TrustManager (verifying the
    server's certificate against trusted CAs).  It could easily be
    extended to allow for two separate keystores by adding another couple
    of methods.

* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) A BitSet is a compact representation if we're only considering
	builtin types that will have low oids, but if any user defined
	types are enabled, all bets are off.  Once the oid counter exceeds
	INT_MAX, database connections were failing outright even if no
	high oid types used binary transfer because we represent these

## Version 9.1-902 (2011-04-18)

* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix ResultSetMetaData retrieval when the oid counter
	exceeds INT_MAX. Since Java doesn't have unsigned ints we retrieve the values
	as long and then truncate to int, so it may have a negative value. Committed by
	jurka. Thanks to Owen Tran .
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Cache a copy of ResultSetMetaData in the ResultSet.
	This solves a major performance problem for ResultSetMetaData users
	which did not cache the ResultSetMetaData object.  One of the users
	is the driver's own implementation of updatable ResultSets, so this
	can't be worked around solely in end user code.
	In the 9.0 and earlier releases, the Field objects were used to hold
	database lookup results and these were longer lived than the
	ResultSetMetaData object.  Now that ResultSetMetaData is holding
	these database lookups we must hold onto the object to avoid
	repeating the database queries. 
	Committed by jurka. Thanks to Steven Schlansker.

## Version 9.1dev-900 (2011-04-18)

* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Add support for setting application_name on both connection
	startup and later through Connection.setClientInfo.
	Committed by jurka.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Fetch all metadata for the ResultSet in one query instead of
	making a trip for each attribute of each column. Committed by jurka.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Bring getSchemas up to JDBC 4 compliance.  Return the additional
	TABLE_CATALOG column that was added in JDBC 3.  Additionally support the getSchemas
	method added in JDBC 4 which filters the returned schemas. Committed by jurka.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Bring getProcedures/getProcedureColumns up to JDBC 4 compliance.
	Both methods have added a SPECIFIC_NAME column that can be used to differentiate
	between overloaded functions. getProcedureColumns has added some other additional
	columns to describe the datatype being returned. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Thor
	Michael Store.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Allow the driver to support setObject with Types.DISTINCT.
	We report metadata indicating that values are of this type, so we'd better accept
	it coming back in. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Vitalii Tymchyshyn.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Support building with the 1.7 JDK. Committed by jurka.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Support returning generated keys from batch statement
	execution. Unfortunately we need to disable the actual batching that the driver
	does behind the scenes because now that it is returning potentially large result
	values we must avoid a deadlock. Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Report permission metadata for a table with no permissions
	correctly. Committed by jurka. Thanks to danap.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Ensure that an XAConnection throws SQLExceptions appropriately
	even though it's a proxy class.  Before this change it was throwing an
	InvocationTargetException instead of the actual cause. Committed by jurka. Thanks
	to Yaocl.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Make updatable ResultSets work with SQLXML data. Committed by
	jurka. Thanks to Michael Musset.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) If a domain has a not null constraint, report that
	information in the metadata for both DatabaseMetaData.getColumns and
	ResultSetMetaData.isNullable. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Thomas Kellerer.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) In DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas, return the user's own
	temp schemas, but no others.  Previously it wasn't returning the users own temp
        schema, but was showing all toast temp schemas. Committed by jurka. Thanks to
	Thomas Kellerer.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Change ResultSetMetaData to return information on serial
	datatypes in getColumnTypeName to match up with the behaviour of DatabaseMetaData.getColumns.
	Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix literals that are injected into a SQL query to contain
	the PG specific E'' marker if they are using the non-standard-conforming-strings
	backslash escaping.  This will get rid of the warnings from escape_string_warning.
	Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Clear the generated keys associated with a Statement at
	the next execution.  If the next execution doesn't want generated keys, we don't
	want to leave the old keys around. Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) The 9.1 server canonicalizes the client_encoding setting,
	so if we ask for unicode we get utf8.  This confused the driver because previous
	versions just echo back what we asked for.  Ask for the canonical name now.
	Committed by jurka. Thanks to Mike Fowler.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) When running tests, don't assume that we know the server's
	default transaction isolation level. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Kevin Grittner.
* ![update](../media/img/update.jpg) Update default permissions to account for changes in
	different server versions.  8.2 removed the rule permission while 8.4 added a
	trunctate permission. Committed by jurka.
* ![update](../media/img/update.jpg) Newer server versions (9.0+) allow extra_float_digits
	to be set to 3 instead of the old limit of 2 to get the maximum precision of
	floating point values out of the server. Committed by jurka.
* ![update](../media/img/update.jpg) Update the date tests for changes in the 1.6 JVM.
	Older versions allowed five digit years and single digit days and months. The
	latest code only allows a strict yyyy-mm-dd.  This changed somewhere between
	1.6.0_11 and 1.6.0_21. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Mike Fowler.
* ![update](../media/img/update.jpg) Use slightly different SQL State error codes for
	the different types of connection setup failures to indicate which can be
	retried and which cannot. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Donald Fraser and
	Kevin Grittner.

## Version 9.0-801 (2010-09-20)

* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Implement returning ASC/DESC order information in
	getIndexInfo. Committed by jurka.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Support PreparedStatement.setObject(int, Character).
	Committed by jurka. Thanks to Vitalii Tymchyshyn.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Work around a bug in the server's implementation of
	the binary copy protocol. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Matthew Wakeling.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Make ResultSetMetaData.getColumnType match the
	results of DatabaseMetaData.getColumns.DATA_TYPE for domain and composite
	types. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Thomas Kellerer.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix DatabaseMetaData.getColumns for 7.2 servers.
	This was accidentally broken in the previous release. Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix a minor concurrency issue during the setup for
	processing escape functions. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Pierre Queinnec.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix DatabaseMetaData routines that return index
	information for a change in the 9.0 server that no longer renames the
	pg_attribute entries for the index, but only adjust the table's attributes
	on a column rename. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Adam Rauch.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Track the tail of the SQLWarning chain so we can
	quickly add a new element to it instead of having to walk the entire chain
	from the head.  This is important for the performance of handling plpgsql
	functions which do a ton of RAISE NOTICES which get translated into warnings.
	Committed by jurka. Thanks to Altaf Malik.

* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Support reading the new hex escaped bytea
	format. Committed by jurka.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Add support for returning the new TRUNCATE
	privilege, that was added in 8.4, to the list of known table privileges.
	Committed by jurka. Thanks to Thomas Kellerer.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Add the partial index constraint to the FILTER_CONDITION
	column returned by DatabaseMetaData.getIndexInfo. Committed by jurka.
	Thanks to Mark Kirkwood.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Japanese translation of error messages. Committed

* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Bulgarian translation of error messages. Committed
	by jurka. Thanks to Viktor Usunov.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Add some more specific types to the return value
	for DatabaseMetaData.getTables.  Return composite types, temporary views,
	and temporary sequences with TABLE_TYPE values specifically for them.
	Committed by jurka. Thanks to Thomas Kellerer.
* ![add](../media/img/add.jpg) Add loglevel and protocolversion options to
	DataSources. Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Remove an unused Sun specific import that prevented
	compilation on non-Sun JDKs. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Tom Lane.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Change the processing of Statement.executeUpdate
	to complain if any of the results of a multi-statement query string return
	a ResultSet.  Previously we were only checking the first result which
	resulted in silent partial execution of later SELECT statements. Committed
	by jurka. Thanks to Joseph Shraibman.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Check that a Connection hasn't been closed before
	allowing any operations on it. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Kevin
	Grittner.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Don't allow rollback or commit when a Connection
	is in autocommit mode. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Kevin Grittner.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Change the SQLStates reported for using a closed
	Connection and closed ResultSet to be more consistent. Report connection_does_not_exist
	(08003) for a closed Connection and object_not_in_state (55000) for a
	ResultSet. Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) When a COPY operation is the first statement
	issued in a transaction, it was not sending the BEGIN necessary to
	start the transaction. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Maciek Sakrejda.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) The 8.4 release added some code to avoid re-describing
	a statement if we already had the type information available by copying
	the resolved type information from the query to the parameters. Its
	goal was just to overwrite parameters without a type (unknown), but it
	was actually overwriting all types which could change the query's desired
	behaviour. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Hiroshi Saito.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix the ORDINAL_POSITION in the DatabaseMetaData.getColumns.
	Previously we were returning simply pg_attribute.attnum, but that doesn't
	work in the presence of dropped columns because later columns don't get
	their attnum decremented if a preceding column is dropped.  Instead use
	the row_number window function for 8.4 and later servers to figure out the
	live column position. Committed by jurka.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Always specify an XA error code when creating an
	XAException. Otherwise a transaction manager won't know what to do with
	the error and may have to assume the worst. Committed by jurka. Thanks to
	Heikki Linnakangas, Justin Bertram.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) LOB truncation didn't allow truncating to zero
	length because it was improperly using the positioning length checks
	which don't allow a zero length. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Simon Kissane.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Protocol sync was lost when a batch statement parameter
	had an embedded null byte. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Pierre Queinnec.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) Fix a problem using the Copy API to copy data to the
	server from a Reader.  After reading data out of the Reader and into a buffer,
	we were sending the entire buffer on to the server, not just the subset of
	it that was filled by the read operation. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Leonardo F.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) A XA transaction should not change the autocommit
	setting of a Connection.  Ensure that we restore this property correctly
	after the XA transaction completes. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Heikki
	Linnakangas, Achilleas Mantzios.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) PoolingDataSources were not picking up all of the
	properties that were set for them.  Notably it would not give you a SSL
	connection when asked. Committed by jurka. Thanks to Eric Jain.
* ![fix](../media/img/fix.jpg) When setNull is called with a TIME or TIMESTAMP
	type we cannot pass that type information on to the backend because we
	really don't know whether it is with or without a time zone. For a NULL
	value it doesn't matter, but we can't establish a type because a later
	call with a non-null value using the same PreparedStatement can potentially
	end up using a specific type that is incorrect. Committed by jurka. Thanks
	to Martti Jeenicke.
